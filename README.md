# PatchyDisc
This is a code to perform NVT simulations of patchy particles. 
Several potentials are available.
The code was built based on the [VMMC library](https://github.com/lohedges/vmmc) of Lester Hedges.

## Requirements
- cmake >= 3.11
- [nlohmann json library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) 

## Compiling PatchyDisc
```
git clone git@github.com:mosayebi/PatchyDisc.git
cd PatchyDisc
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
A successfull compilation will create the executable file `build/PatchyDisc`.

## Running examples

```
cd examples
../build/PatchyDisc input_mixture.json
```
This will run a simulation using the parameters configureed in the `input_mixture.json`.


## IMPORTANT

due to update to the work, examples are currently unavailable. they will be added with the next commit. for the moment refer to the example input below.

## Input file

Below is the contents of a sample input file for simulating a mixture of tri-valent and bi-valent patchy discs.

Currently, the following interactions are implemented

- `GaussianPatchyDisc` -- The model is described in this [reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06626). with the addition to consider if a patch is in an active or inactive state
- `KFSurfOpenPatchyDisc` -- The model is a Kern-Frenkel potential that consider if a patch is in an active or inactive state

----- Not Tested yet
- `GaussianPatchyDiscHR` -- Same as the `GaussianPatchyDisc`, but with a hard core repulsion when particles overlap (i.e. when $r_{ij} \lt \sigma_{ij}$).
- `GaussianPatchyDiscHRSW` -- Same as the `GaussianPatchyDiscHR`, but with a Square-Well poential when particles are within the interaction range (i.e. when $r_{ij} \le {r_{cut}}_{ij}$).

## Important

please note that there is a surface interaction term that is active when particles interact. to turn it off it is necessary to modify in src/gaussian_patchy.cpp the term "surface_interaction"

## Visualisation
The trajectory is saved in XYZ format. You can vissualise it in the visualaisation package of your choice. However, I recommend using [ovito](https://www.ovito.org/).

When importing the trajectory in ovito, please choose the follwing order for the column mappings: Particle type, Position X, Position Y, Orientation Z, Orientation W. You can then load particle shape STL files saved in the `UTILS/particle_shapes/` if you are simulating a standard patchy disc, or make your own particle shape using the python script provided.

To load a particle shape in ovito under the "Data source" panel click on "Particle Types" and choose a particle type. The "Load shape..."  button can then be found in the bottom of the panel.
